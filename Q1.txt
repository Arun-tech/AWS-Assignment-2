Step 1: First we start by launching an instance with ubuntu as AMI. 
        The instance has to be configured with HTTP and Https in security group.

Step 2: Execute the following shell script which installs apache server and adds index.html file.


Script file :-

#!/bin/bash
sudo apt get update 
sudo apt -y install apache2
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/html/trialsite
sudo chown ubuntu /var/www/
sudo chmod -R o+r /var/www/
sudo chown -R 755 /var/www/
echo "<html><body><h1> Hello Everyone, Welcome to my website. </h1></boody></html>" > /var/www/html/trialsite/index.html
sudo cp /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default-conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/trialsite.config

Step 3: The image of the instance is created.

Step 4: Under Auto scaling, go to launch configurations, and select the configuration.

Step 5: Complete the auto scaling group creation.

Step 6: Choose the launch configuration you have created.

Step 7: Select the group size, the network and the 2 subnet in different availability zones

Step 8: Click on configure load balancer.

Step 9: We now choose a classic load balancer.

Step 10: We then assign security gps and provide a certificate.
         Then configure health check.

Step 11: Under Load balancing, create a target group.

Step 11: Go to auto scaling groups and choose your group and edit it. 

Step 12: Here add the load balancer and the target gps that we have created.

The listner configuration would:

Load Balancer Protocol   Load Balancer Port   Instance Protocol  Instance Port   Cipher   SSL Certificate
     HTTP                       80                  HTTP              80           N/A         N/A
