Step 1: We start by launching 2 ec2 instances
        1st instance :- arun1
        2nd instance :- arun2
Step 2: Go to MobaXterm. Open SSH into instance arun1

Step 3: Enter the following command

Step 11: Remove the content, and enter the public key of instance "arun1" into the file.

Step 12: Now enter the ssh IP address of "arun2" in "arun1"
